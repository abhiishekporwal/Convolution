# Logo Detection
This repo is useful for the detection of logo(s) in an image. Logo can be either in the form symbol or caligraphic.

I have prepared a Demo file "LogoDetection.ipynb" which contains my approach to solve this problem. I had used google colab platform. 

To run the LogoDetection.ipynb file. Make sure you are using colab notebook.

    • Run cells of the given file by using shift+enter or ctrl+enter.
    • After loading of model, upload all the images provided in input_samples folder or you can use your own images. 
      You can upload as many images. This will take sometime.
    • After uploading your images, run all the remaining cells.

Checkout our demo notebook for loading checkpoints and performing inference
